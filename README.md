MoCCACapstone2014 - Potlach
=============================

This is my submission for the first edition of Mobile Cloud Computing with Android specialization Capstone Project held on Coursera.org. This submission got 100% however it is not free from issues. (For example there are some minor errors in logic, that I made just before the submission deadline….)

Demonstration videos are here: http://vimeo.com/113253491, here http://vimeo.com/113253268 and here: http://vimeo.com/113250287 .

This project however can be interesting for people looking for examples how to use some of mentioned below technologies.

Android:
I tryed to make the client non-blocking. For this purpose I used Square Otto event queue. There are also some other awesome libraries involved like Square Picasso and Square Retrofit.

Server side:                   
Spring MVC framework (without Spring Boot) with Spring Security deployable to Google App Engine. (The project originally worked on Google App Engine but for the submission time was changed to localhost because I runned out from quota.).
For data storage Google Datastore is used with JDO.

I don’t plan to continue this project.
